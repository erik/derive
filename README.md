Generate a heatmap from GPS tracks.

Drag and drop one or more GPX/TCX/FIT/IGC files or JPEG images into the browser
window. No data is ever uploaded, everything is done client side.

Loosely inspired by [The Passage Ride](http://thepassageride.com), which you
should join if you ever find yourself in Los Angeles on any given Wednesday
night.

## Strava

If you use Strava, go to your
[account download page](https://www.strava.com/athlete/delete_your_account)
and click "Request your archive". You'll get an email containing a ZIP
file of all the GPS tracks you've logged so far. This can take several hours.
