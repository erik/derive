Generate a heatmap from GPS tracks.

Drag and drop one or more GPX/TCX/FIT files or JPEG images into the browser
window. No data is ever uploaded, everything is done client side.

Loosely inspired by [The Passage Ride](http://thepassageride.com), which you
should join if you ever find yourself in Los Angeles on any given Wednesday
night.

## Strava

If you use Strava, go to your
[account download page](https://www.strava.com/athlete/delete_your_account)
and click "Request your archive". You'll get an email containing a ZIP
file of all the GPS tracks you've logged so far: this can take several hours.

## Runtastic

If you use Runtastic(ADIDAS), go to your export page(which in settings) 
and click the "Export" button after a few minutes. You'll get an email 
that notifies you that the export is complete. And go back to the export page,
click the "Download" button that you can get a ZIP file of all your tracks. 
Then you can use [runtastic-gpx](https://github.com/glennreyes/runtastic-gpx) 
to convert Runtastic exports to gpx.
